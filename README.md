Short description: Computational Linguistics and NLP scripts for JCU researchers

Long description:
This repository is devoted to Jupyter Notebook files that provide helpful examples and training for researchers in the Language and Culture Research Centre, James Cook University, and for whoever else ultimately finds these useful.

There are currently three Jupyter Notebook files in the folder:
1) NLP_Intro.ipynb: provides a basic introduction to basic NLP tasks, namely word tokenization, training word embeddings, POS tagging, lemmatization, and tree parsing.
2) clf_grouping_presentation.ipynb: gives an example for using word embeddings to explore semantic groupings in nouns that co-occur with a given classifier. This will be featured in a more polished form on the Hmong Medical Corpus Blog (https://hmcorpus.home.blog/) at a later date.
nltk_sentence_data_mining_presentation.ipynb: provides an introducing to doing data mining with NLTK.
